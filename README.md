# SVM-Analysis---Radial-vs-Polynomial-kernel-function
Build and train an SVM classifier with polynomial kernel function. P=2,3,4. 

  Use 60-40 “cut” to train and verify the classifier. 
  Repeat 10 times and get the average accuracy-purity matrix. Also use Leave-One-Out method to train and verify the classifier
  
Repeat above for radial basis function with s = 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0.
